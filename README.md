## Everything about javascript and DOM

### Adding Event Listeners

> We have button and we want to execute a function when the button got clicked, so how we do that?

We add `event listeners` to the button and tell it what type of event we want to use and what to do when event got triggered basically executing a function.

And we something like below,

`element(obj).addEventListener('click', name_of_function)`

Eg:

```
handleClick() {
    console.log('I got clicked');
} // this will be the function that will be triggered when the click event has been identified
button_obj = document.querySelector('button');
button_obj.addEventListener('click', handleClick);
```

> Note: we don't add parenthesis when we use function name in addEventListener method, instead of straight forward call we are using this function

Out in the wild, people use anonymous function

```
button_obj.addEventListener('click', function() {
    console.log('I got clicked');
});
```

### Higher Order Functions: Passing Functions as Input

We have passed function name without parenthesis inside the addEventListener Function and that is what is exactly known as higher order function.

> Higher Order functions are the functions that take other functions as input

Example;

```
function add(num1, num2) {
   return num1 + num2;
}

function subtract(num1, num2) {
    return num1 - num2;
}

function calculator(num1,  num2, operator) {
    return operator(num1, num2);
}

//Function call
calculator(2, 3, add); --> 5
calculator(4, 2, subtract); --> 2
```

### Adding Sound and dealing with JavaScript this keyword

To add a sound we use Audio() class and then we create a object from it

```
var audio = new Audio('/path to audio file');
audio.play();
```

:index pointing up: Here we have created a audio object and then we used one of it's method name play()

**JavaScript $${\color{yellow}this}$$**

On adding eventListener to the button and then we console.log `this` we get whole element as output

```
<button>Click me</button>

document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', function() {
    console.log(this); // will print the button element
    this.style.color = 'red'; // we can also manipulate the element using this
})
```

### JavaScript Object and Custructor Function

#### JavaScript Object

JavaScript object allows us to have a variable with properties and methods. Just think of it as real world objects
for say **Humans** have properties like name, age and many more, Similarly we can create a object which can have many features and functionality

Syntax for declaring an object

```
var object = {
    property1: something...,
    property2: something...
}

var student = {
    name: 'Jack',
    age: '15',
    id: 23
}
```

We can access the properties of object using dot(.) notation or using key
For eg:
student.name -> Jack
student['age']

#### JavaScript Constructor Function

Let's suppose if we want to create records for 100 students then by using above declaration it would take long time. Since every students will have same properties so instead of declaring each properties again for every student we will create a constructor function which will behave as a blueprint for the student objects

> Note: Initials should be capital while defining name of the constructor function

Syntax for declaring constructor function

```
function StudentsRecord(name, age, yearOfJoining, courses) {
    this.name = name, // we are using **this** for object
    this.age = age,
    this.yearsOfJoining = yearsOfJoining
    this.courses = courses
}

Initializing an StudentsRecord Object
var student1 = new StudentsRecord('Jack', 14, 2000, ['Maths', 'Physics', 'Chemistry']);
var student2 = new StudentsRecord('Rose', 15, 1999, ['Maths', 'Economics', 'Statistics']);
```

> Here we use **new** for calling the constructor function

We can access the properties each student similar to accessing objects
student1.name;
student2['age'];
