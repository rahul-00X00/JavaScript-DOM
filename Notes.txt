Adding Event Listeners


We have button and we want to execute a function when the button got clicked, so how we do that?

We add event listeners to the button and tell it what type of event we want to use and what to do when event got triggered basically executing a function.

And we something like below,

element(obj).addEventListener('click', name_of_function)



Eg:

handleClick() {
    console.log('I got clicked');
} // this will be the function that will be triggered when the click event has been identified
button_obj = document.querySelector('button');
button_obj.addEventListener('click', handleClick); 


Note: we don't add parenthesis when we use function name in addEventListener method, instead of straight forward call we are using this function as input.



Out in the wild, people use anonymous function

button_obj.addEventListener('click', function() {
    console.log('I got clicked');
});
